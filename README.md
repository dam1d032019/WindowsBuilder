Windows Image Customization Tool 
================================
WindowsBuilder is a tool for servicing Windows `WIM` image. You can now deep customize your Windows installation with ease!

```batchfile
C:\WindowsBuilder\> powershell -Command "& { wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buildcenter/WindowsBuilder/master/scaffold.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex }"
C:\WindowsBuilder\> build configure
C:\WindowsBuilder\> build mount
C:\WindowsBuilder\> build
C:\WindowsBuilder\> build dismount
```

Congrats! Your shiny new Windows image is ready!

We have prepared a [detailed walkthrough ](./docs/walkthrough.md) here.


We Need Undo
============
Good news!

```batchfile
C:\repo\> build dismount undo
```

Mounting and dismounting can take quite a while, depending on your hard disk I/O performance. You definitely want to run this on a good SSD.


Schema
======
The source in [/src/global.bsd](./src/global.bsd) contains global settings. Each subfolder under `/src` contain their own schema. You should be able figure everything out just by looking at the comments.

Specific schematics are documented [in the docs](http://buildcenter.github.io/WindowsBuilder/schema).

Since everything is script and template driven, you should just [look at the source](./tools/WindowsBuilder) whenever in doubt.
